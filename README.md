# Pure Honey Landing Page
A modern, conversion-focused landing page for a honey producing company.

## About
This project redesigns a honey company's sales page from the ground up. The original version was one of my first projects from the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design curriculum, but it needed a complete makeover to look more professional and appealing.

## Project Goals
- Create a clean, simple landing page focused on selling
- Design with conversion in mind, not just to look fancy
- Build a trustworthy brand presence for a honey company
- Provide an easy way for customers to request free samples

## Design Process
- Wireframing: Created high-fidelity wireframes before coding
- Color Palette: Warm, natural colors that reflect honey and nature
- Typography: Clean, readable fonts that build trust
- Layout: Simple, conversion-focused structure
